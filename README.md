Welcome to the source repository of the Minecraft modification **Ulti's Simple Recipes**.

It adds multiple new recipes to the game making the crafting processes less complex. Please use a mod like JEI or REI to see all new recipes.


## Modpack
You can use this mod in every modpack that is available for free. You are allowed to distribute the mod file in an own ModPack launcher.
If the modpack is not distributed via CurseForge, you need to add a link to this repository, [my website](https://berger-media.biz/downloads/12/minecraft/ultis-simple-recipes) or the [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ultis-simple-recipes) of this modification.


### Multi-Loader
Since Version **2023.3.0**, besides Forge the mod is also available for Fabric and NeoForge. To make it build-able from single sources, the  [MultiLoader-Template](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template/) was used.
